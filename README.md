The York Expedition - Your Travel Safety Companion
========================

Travel media made specifically for people of color and women is really popular on social media right now - and for a reason. People want to be informed about the places they travel to before they go, to avoid any possible safety risks as well as to have an enjoyable travel experience. We want to build a place where users can find this kind of information in one place instead of having to sift through many accounts on many social media platforms.

Our application will visualize data revolving around hate, race-based, or gender-based crimes to inform the user of possible areas that they should be more cautious about or avoid altogether to facilitate a more convenient and safer travel experience.

We will also suggest minority-owned businesses and minority-friendly experiences to our users to support these kinds of establishments.

In order to do all of this we will be relying on FBI crime data, Federal data on Minority Business, as well as Twitter sentiment analysis for different travel destinations from twitter users of different demographics.

We built it by using HTML and CSS templates and then modifying them to fit our needs.

Ideally, we would have used Google Maps API, FBI crime statistics, and Twitter sentiments to visualize the data for our users in a heat-map of colors representing desirable travel destinations as well as destinations to avoid.
